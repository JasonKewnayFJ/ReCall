**ReCall** is a lightweight and utilitarian Windows application that saves everything you've copied. It helps prevent losing clipboard data.

## 🔍 Problem

You copied important text, accidentally overwrote it — and the needed content disappeared.  
The clipboard holds only **one value**, and everything before it vanishes.

## ✅ Solution

**ReCall** stores the full clipboard history and lets you quickly return to needed entries.

## 📦 Updates

I made ReCall for myself and use it daily.  
At this stage, its functionality fully satisfies me.

However, if you have ideas to improve the UX — feel free to email me.  
If the suggestion makes sense — I’ll be glad to improve it.
