📝 ReCall — Clipboard History
ReCall is a lightweight and utilitarian Windows application that keeps everything you've copied. It helps prevent losing data from the clipboard.

🔍 Problem
You copied an important text, accidentally overwrote it — and the needed content was gone.
The clipboard stores only one value, and everything before it disappears.

✅ Solution
ReCall saves the full clipboard history and allows you to quickly return to previous entries.

🚀 Features
📌 History — everything you’ve copied stays in the app

🧠 Current value — what’s currently in the clipboard

🕓 Previous value — what was there before

🧾 Full list — all entries in a convenient timeline

🖱️ Controls
🔘 LMB on an entry — instantly restores it to the clipboard

📥 Hide — minimizes the app to the background

❌ Exit — fully closes the app

🧊 Ctrl + Shift + R — global hotkey to open the app

🛠️ Highlights
Works on any Windows PC

Low resource usage and runs in the background

Minimalist interface without clutter

No cloud, no third-party services, no telemetry

📦 Updates
I created ReCall for myself and use it daily.
At this point, its functionality fully satisfies me.

However, if you have ideas to improve the UX — feel free to email me.
If the suggestion is reasonable — I’ll gladly implement it.

ReCall is made so you never lose important information again. Just copy — and it stays with you.
