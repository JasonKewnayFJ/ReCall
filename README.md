# üìù ReCall ‚Äî Clipboard History

ReCall is a lightweight and utilitarian Windows app that saves everything you copy. It helps prevent loss of data from the clipboard.

## üîç Problem

You copy important text, accidentally overwrite it ‚Äî and the needed data is lost.
The clipboard only holds one value, and everything before it disappears.

## ‚úÖ Solution

ReCall saves the full clipboard history and lets you quickly get back to the entries you need.
